âœ¨ Welcome to my express.js-based project! This project is a simple API application that uses the products-api repository as a backend for managing products. It provides RESTful APIs for fetching and managing products. The APIs are accessible through JSON web services and provide a simple and intuitive interface. This project is an open-source initiative that aims to provide a unified and efficient way to manage products using APIs. Explore and contribute to the project!
